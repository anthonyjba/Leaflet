# vector-tile-spec
The Vector Tile format uses Google Protocol Buffers as a encoding format. Protocol Buffers are a language-neutral, platform-neutral extensible mechanism for serializing structured data

# mbtiles-spec
MBTiles is a specification for storing tiled map data in SQLite databases for immediate usage and for transfer. MBTiles files, known as tilesets, must implement the specification below to ensure compatibility with devices.

UTFGrid: The MBTiles specification previously contained the UTFGrid specification. It was removed in version 1.2 and moved into its own specification with synced version numbers - so MBTiles 1.2 is compatible with UTFGrid 1.2. The specs integrate but do not require each other for compliance.

# rbush
RBush â€” a high-performance JavaScript R-tree-based 2D spatial index for points and rectangles

Demos: [uniformly distributed random data](http://mourner.github.io/rbush/viz/viz-uniform.html), [randomly clustered data](http://mourner.github.io/rbush/viz/viz-cluster.html)
source: https://github.com/mourner/rbush

## Performance
 
 The following sample performance test was done by generating
 random uniformly distributed rectangles of ~0.01% area and setting `maxEntries` to `16`
 (see `debug/perf.js` script).
 Performed with Node.js v5.2.0 on a Retina Macbook Pro 15 (mid-2012).
 
 Test                         | RBush  | [old RTree](https://github.com/imbcmdth/RTree) | Improvement
